## Job Market Analysis: Data-Driven Career Strategy
**A comprehensive analysis of job market trends to inform job search timing and location decisions.**


### 🎯 Project Overview
As an unemployed professional considering relocation, I used data analysis to answer: Where and when should I focus my job search?


### Key Questions Addressed:
- Is the "September surge" in hiring real?
- Which cities offer the best opportunities for my target roles?
- How should seasonal patterns influence job search timing?
- What job types perform best in different markets?


### 📊 Key Findings
>🔥 September Surge Confirmed
> - 42.6% increase in job postings during September compared to other months
> - January also shows strong hiring activity (secondary peak)
> - Summer and holiday months show significant slowdowns


>🏆 Market Leaders
> - Overall Winner: San Francisco Data Analyst (highest combined score)
> - Northeast Winner: New York Data Analyst (best among target cities)
> - Consistent Pattern: Data Analyst emerged as top job type across ALL target cities


>📅 Optimal Timing Strategy
> - Peak Month: September (~112 NYC Data Analyst jobs expected)
> - Secondary Peak: January
> - Recommendation: Intensive search efforts during September, preparation during August


### 🛠️ Technical Approach

#### Data & Methodology
- Scope: 8 cities × 6 job types × 20 months = 960 data points
- Time Period: January 2023 - August 2024
- Scoring System: Combined job volume and salary metrics (normalized 0-1 scale)
- Cities Analyzed: NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles

#### Tools Used
- **R** for data analysis and visualization
- **ggplot2** for data visualization
- **dplyr** for data manipulation
- **Statistical analysis** for seasonal trend testing

### 🎯 Strategic Recommendations
>Primary Strategy
> - Focus: NYC Data Analyst positions
> - Timing: Intensive search in September
> - Rationale: Highest score (0.987) among Northeast target cities

>Backup Strategy
> - Alternative: Boston Data Analyst (score: 0.868)
> - Consideration: San Francisco Data Analyst (highest overall: 0.996)

>Timing Tactics
> - September: Peak hiring month (+42.6% jobs)
> - January: Secondary peak for backup timing
> - Avoid: Summer months and holiday season
