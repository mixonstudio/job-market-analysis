## Job Market Analysis: Data-Driven Career Strategy
**A comprehensive analysis of job market trends to inform job search timing and location decisions.**


### 🎯 Project Overview
As an unemployed professional considering relocation, I used data analysis to answer: Where and when should I focus my job search?


###Key Questions Addressed:
- Is the "September surge" in hiring real?
- Which cities offer the best opportunities for my target roles?
- How should seasonal patterns influence job search timing?
- What job types perform best in different markets?


###📊 Key Findings
>🔥 September Surge Confirmed
- 42.6% increase in job postings during September compared to other months
- January also shows strong hiring activity (secondary peak)
- Summer and holiday months show significant slowdowns


>🏆 Market Leaders
- Overall Winner: San Francisco Data Analyst (highest combined score)
- Northeast Winner: New York Data Analyst (best among target cities)
- Consistent Pattern: Data Analyst emerged as top job type across ALL target cities


>📅 Optimal Timing Strategy
- Peak Month: September (~112 NYC Data Analyst jobs expected)
- Secondary Peak: January
- Recommendation: Intensive search efforts during September, preparation during August


###🛠️ Technical Approach
####Data & Methodology
- Scope: 8 cities × 6 job types × 20 months = 960 data points
- Time Period: January 2023 - August 2024
- Scoring System: Combined job volume and salary metrics (normalized 0-1 scale)
- Cities Analyzed: NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles

####Tools Used
- R for data analysis and visualization
- ggplot2 for data visualization
- dplyr for data manipulation
- Statistical analysis for seasonal trend testing

###🎯 Strategic Recommendations
>Primary Strategy
- Focus: NYC Data Analyst positions
- Timing: Intensive search in September
- Rationale: Highest score (0.987) among Northeast target cities

>Backup Strategy
- Alternative: Boston Data Analyst (score: 0.868)
- Consideration: San Francisco Data Analyst (highest overall: 0.996)

>Timing Tactics
- September: Peak hiring month (+42.6% jobs)
- January: Secondary peak for backup timing
- Avoid: Summer months and holiday season
