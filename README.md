Job Market Analysis: Data-Driven Career Strategy
A comprehensive analysis of job market trends to inform job search timing and location decisions.

🎯 Project Overview
As an unemployed professional considering relocation, I used data analysis to answer: Where and when should I focus my job search?

Key Questions Addressed:
Is the "September surge" in hiring real?
Which cities offer the best opportunities for my target roles?
How should seasonal patterns influence job search timing?
What job types perform best in different markets?

📊 Key Findings
🔥 September Surge Confirmed

42.6% increase in job postings during September compared to other months
January also shows strong hiring activity (secondary peak)
Summer and holiday months show significant slowdowns

🏆 Market Leaders

Overall Winner: San Francisco Data Analyst (highest combined score)
Northeast Winner: New York Data Analyst (best among target cities)
Consistent Pattern: Data Analyst emerged as top job type across ALL target cities

📅 Optimal Timing Strategy

Peak Month: September (~112 NYC Data Analyst jobs expected)
Secondary Peak: January
Recommendation: Intensive search efforts during September, preparation during August

🛠️ Technical Approach
Data & Methodology

Scope: 8 cities × 6 job types × 20 months = 960 data points
Time Period: January 2023 - August 2024
Scoring System: Combined job volume and salary metrics (normalized 0-1 scale)
Cities Analyzed: NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Portland, Los Angeles

Tools Used

R for data analysis and visualization
ggplot2 for data visualization
dplyr for data manipulation
Statistical analysis for seasonal trend testing

🎯 Strategic Recommendations
Primary Strategy

Focus: NYC Data Analyst positions
Timing: Intensive search in September
Rationale: Highest score (0.987) among Northeast target cities

Backup Strategy

Alternative: Boston Data Analyst (score: 0.868)
Consideration: San Francisco Data Analyst (highest overall: 0.996)

Timing Tactics

September: Peak hiring month (+42.6% jobs)
January: Secondary peak for backup timing
Avoid: Summer months and holiday season
